# Setting up Pre-configured PostgreSQL DB w/ pgAdmin4 in Docker

This docker-compose file spins up a PostgreSQL database along with an instance of PgAdmin4 which can be accessed from a browser

## HOW TO RUN

### Defining custom dump files

The files in the `sql` directory are called dump files.

- Each file reflects a different SQL database
- The `init.sh` file goes through each file, creates the corresponding database in PostgreSQL, and runs the contents of that SQL file against the corresponding database

> [! NOTE] Initial SQL files in this repo were generated by ChatGPT

### Spinning Up the Docker Compose File + Initializing / Seeding Databases via init.sh

1. `cd` into directory containing `init.sh` file
2. Make sure that the `init.sh` file is executable. If it is not, use `chmod +x init.sh`
3. Execute the `init.sh` file

```bash
./init.sh
```

`init.sh` does the following things:

- Loads `.env` file to gain access to environmental variables (needed by the `init.sh` file itself)
- Initializes `docker-compose.yaml` file via `docker compose up -d`
- Creates PostgreSQL databases and loads into them the dump files as defined by .sql files in the `sql` directory
  - Each database name is the same as the `sql` file name

### Spin Down the Docker Compose File

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

**NOTE:** `-v` option removes any created volumes (while optional, it is recommended)

## Access postgres db from cli

```bash
docker exec -it <container name> bash
psql -U <POSTGRES_USER> <POSTGRES_DB>
```

1st step accesses bash shell within the docker db container
2nd step accesses psql db from within the terminal

**NOTE:** `<POSTGRES_USER>` and `<POSTGRES_DB>` are specified by the `.env` file
**NOTE:** To exit the bash cli, use `CTRL` + `d`

## Access pgAdmin4 using web browser

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:<PGADMIN_PORT>` (from `.env` file)
2. You will be prompted to login with username and password. Use .env credentials `<PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL>` AND `<PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD>`
3. Add a "Name" to your database under the "General" tab
4. Click on "Add New Server" in pgAdmin homepage
5. In the "Connection" tab, enter the following information:
   a. Host name/address -- `db` (The name of database service defined in `docker-compose`)
   b. Port -- `<DB_PORT>` (`5432` is the default PostgreSQL port number)
   c. Maintenance database -- `<POSTGRES_DB>`(The name of the database specified in .env file)
   d. Username -- `<POSTGRES_USER>`
   e. Password -- `<POSTGRES_PASSWORD>`
6. Click "Save" to save the server configuration
7. Your PostgreSQL server should now appear under the "Servers" section in homepage
8. Click on the server name to expand the database tree and view your databases, tables, etc.
